This repository contains the code to train and infer ChartCoder. 

## Overview

![main](fig/main.png)

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/thunlp/ChartCoder.git
```
2.  Create environment
```
cd MMedAgent
conda create -n chartcoder python=3.10 -y
conda activate chartcoder
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
```
3. Additional packages required for training
```
pip install -e ".[train]"
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## Models
|  Model   | Download Link  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| MLP Connector |  [projector](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_LwG65TIz_miW39rFPhuEAb5ClgopYi/view?usp=drive_link)  |
| ChartCoder  |  [ChartCoder](https://huggingface.co/xxxllz/ChartCoder)  |

The MLP Connector is our pre-trained MLP weights, which you could directly use for SFT.

## Train
The whole training process consists of two stages. To train the ChartCoder, ```siglip-so400m-patch14-384``` and ```deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct``` should be downloaded first.

For **Pre-training**, run
```
bash scripts/train/pretrain_siglip.sh
```
For **SFT**, run 
```
bash scripts/train/finetune_siglip_a4.sh
```
Please change the model path to your local path. See the corresponding ```.sh ``` file for details. 
We also provide other training scripts, such as using CLIP ```_clip``` and multiple machines ```_m```. See ``` scripts/train ``` for further information.

## Inference
Please see ```inference.py``` for details.

## Results
Please refer to our paper for detailed performance on ChartMimic, Plot2Code and ChartX benchmarks. Thanks for these contributions to the chart-to-code field.
